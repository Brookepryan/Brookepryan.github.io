Apart from just my studies, I learned a lot about Spanish culture, art, and history through experience.\n\n\nTake a look at some of my photos from the trip!!\n\n\n\n\n¡He aprendido mucho desde que comencé estudiar español en UCSB hace dos años!\n\n\nAdemás de enseñar la competencia lingüística, la carrera de español abarca una diversa gama de materias que incluyen lingüística, lengua y traducción, estudios de español peninsular, estudios latinoamericanos, estudios Latinx en Estados Unidos, y lenguas y culturas indígenas de las Américas.\n\n\n¡Tuve la oportunidad de desarrollar mis habilidades para hablar español mientras vivía en Madrid, España durante un semestre!\n\n\nDurante mi estancia en Madrid, asistí a la Universidad Complutense y tomé clases de Teatro Latinoamericano, Literatura Española Actual y el Cuento Español. Aparte de mis estudios, aprendí muchas sobre la cultura, arte y historia española a través de experiencias.\n\n\n¡Echa un vistazo a algunas de las fotos de mi estancia en Madrid!\n\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n:::{layout=“[[1,1], [1,1,1]]}"
