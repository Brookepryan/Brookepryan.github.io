    "section": "",
    "text": "As the threat of wildfires continues to grow, many are looking towards indigenous knowledge and practices of using fire to maintain the landscape. This can prevent devastating megafires and promote forest health. While prescribed burns offer numerous ecological and cultural benefits, the presence of bark and ambrosia beetles can complicate these outcomes. These insects infest trees by boring beneath the bark, creating spaces to grow and reproduce. In the process, they introduce various fungi into the trees’ sapwood, which can sometimes lead to tree mortality. Since bark and ambrosia beetles tend to target stressed or dying trees, I am investigating whether prescribed burns in infested areas might inadvertently boost beetle populations, potentially increasing tree mortality.\nTo explore this, I am studying blue oak and coast live oak species following prescribed burns at Sedgwick Reserve, focusing on bark and ambrosia beetle species belonging to Monarthrum and Pseudopityophthorus genera. My approach combines visual surveys and pheromone trapping to quantify changes in beetle populations. This research aims to better understand how these beetles should be managed in fire-prone ecosystems."

These galleries affect tree health in several ways: some beetle species lay their larvae inside the galleries and introduce fungi that serve as food for their offspring. Other species use the galleries as shelter while feeding on the tree’s cambium, a vital living layer responsible for transporting nutrients."

With themes of realness, rawness, and humanity, this piece honored the dancers not only as performers, but as individual artists with their own stories to tell.\nI designed large, billowing skirts that accentuate the playfulness on the choerography. The costumes are primarily white to symbolize innocence and youth, however, each of the seven dancers had a unique color accent on their top and on the bottom-most layer of their skirt. As each dancer moved across the stage, their skirts moved with them, flashing a fun pop of color and personailty. When the dancers stood together, it formed a color pattern reminiscent of a golden sunset palate, reflecting the sun setting on their childhood and the transition into adulthood and independance."
