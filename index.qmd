## About Me
Hi there! My name is Brooke and I recently graduated from the University of California, Santa Barbara with a double major in Environmental Studies and Spanish. I love bugs, being outdoors, sewing, design, and traveling.

## Currently
I am working as a research assistant with Lee Anderegg's Landscape Ecophysiology and Function (LEAF) Lab at UCSB. I plan to continue my career in research by getting my PhD in Entomology!
