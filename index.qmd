## About Me
Hi there! My name is Brooke and I am from Pittsburgh, Pa. I moved to California in 2021 to attend the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I recently completed my studies. This site is a portfolio of my professional and academic experince, as well as an outlet to show off my personal interests like entomology and sewing/design. Thanks for visiting, I hope you enjoy!

## Currently
I graduated from UCSB with a double major in Environmnetal Studies & Spanish in the spring of 2025. I am now working as a lab technician with Lee Anderegg's Landscape Ecophysiology and Function (LEAF) Lab and investigating a personal research project on wood-boring beetles and their relationship with fire events. I plan to continue my career in research by getting my PhD in Entomology or Invertebrate Ecology!
