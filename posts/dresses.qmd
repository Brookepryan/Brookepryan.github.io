Over the course of a quarter at UCSB, I collaborated with a design team to create costumes for two dance pieces in UCSB's 2025 Spring Dance Concert : Afterlight. I worked closesly with the lighting designer and choreographer of each piece to make their visions become a reality. 

## Piece 1
We Were Light

This dance was a whimsical piece centered around the concepts of relationships and storyteling. With themes of realness, rawness, and humanity, the performance honored the dancers not only as performers, but as individual artists with their own stories to tell.

## Piece 2
The Point Being

design statement: we were never strangers. its undoing, its endurable. unwrap what you have done and we shall not flinch. this is the ache of being alive and beautiful. this is the unfair proximity to a dream.
