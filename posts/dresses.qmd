I designed and crafted two styles of slow-fashion, athletic swimwear: a one-piece swimsuit and a two piece bikini. Both items are reversible (brown and black), seamless, and extremely comfortable. I designed the items to be long-lasting, which I feel is one of the most important qualities for sustainable clothing.
