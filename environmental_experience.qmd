I am a research assistant in the Anderegg Landscape Ecophysiology And Function (LEAF) Lab at UCSB. I am currently helping with a project quantifying the phsyiological impacts of prescribed fire on oak trees. I also am conducting a personal research project on the impact of bark beetles on varietal oak woodlands after fire events.
