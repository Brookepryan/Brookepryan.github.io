I am a research assistant at UCSB, working in both the Anderegg Landscape Ecophysiology and Function (LEAF) Lab and Carla D'Antonio's Vegetation Lab. The projects I am currently involved in focus on quantifying the physiological effects of prescribed fire on oak trees and identifying potential drivers of vegetation change in Mediterranean ecosystems. In addition to this work, I am conducting a personal research project examining the impact of bark beetles on oak woodlands after fire events.
