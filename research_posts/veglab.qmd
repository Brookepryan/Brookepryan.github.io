I assist researchers in Carla D'Antonio's VegLab at UCSB on a project identifying factors influencing vegetation changes in Mediterranean ecosystems. I perform field work measuring plant growth, and soil moisture content, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). I also contribute to data inputting and organization of the collected data.
