I work with Dr. Lee Anderegg's Landscape Ecophysiology lab on a project quantifying the Physiological Effects of Prescribed Fire on Oak Trees. This research takes place at Sedgwick Reserve, where I assist in collecting branch samples and measuring leaf and stem conductance, minimum stomatal conductance, and thermal vulnerability curves. Additionally, I help input, organize, and analyze the data collected during the research.
